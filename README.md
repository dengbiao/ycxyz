to generat a clean branch of `book`,please execute following command:

$ git checkout -b clean-book    # create a clean branch and checkout it
$ git cherry-pick book-cleaner-beg..book-cleaner-end    # cherry-pick range  of clean commits

since that, we had a clean branch of `book` named `clean-book`
